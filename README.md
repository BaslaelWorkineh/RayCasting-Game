# Doom-Style Game in Pure C

A simple Doom-style 3D game engine written in pure C using SDL2 for graphics. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of raycasting-based 3D rendering, similar to the original Doom engine.

## Features

- **Raycasting 3D Engine**: Renders a 3D world from a 2D map using raycasting
- **Player Movement**: WASD controls for movement and rotation
- **Simple Map System**: 2D grid-based world with walls and empty spaces
- **Distance-based Shading**: Walls get darker with distance for depth perception
- **Real-time Rendering**: 60 FPS game loop with smooth movement
